# Localization

Selektable widgets support multiple languages out of the box, with the ability to customize strings per locale.

## Supported languages

| Locale | Language |
|--------|----------|
| `en` | English (default) |
| `nl` | Dutch |
| `de` | German |

## How locale detection works

The widget determines the active locale in this order:

1. **Translation service:** If Weglot is detected on the page, the widget uses the current Weglot language
2. **Widget configuration:** The default locale set in the widget config
3. **Fallback:** English (`en`)

## Weglot integration

If your site uses [Weglot](https://weglot.com) for translation, the widget automatically:

1. Detects the current Weglot language on widget open
2. Listens for language changes and updates the widget in real-time

No configuration needed. The embed script handles this automatically.

## Custom locale strings

You can customize the text shown in widgets through the widget configuration in the dashboard. Each locale supports these categories of strings:

### Variant strings

Text specific to the widget type (room visualizer or virtual try-on):

- Upload prompt text
- Generation loading text
- Result heading

### Marketing strings

- Marketing consent checkbox label
- Post-generation CTA text

### Integration strings

- WhatsApp share message text

## Adding a custom locale

To support a language beyond en/nl/de, configure custom locale strings in the widget settings. The widget will use your custom strings when the detected locale matches.

<Note>
  App-level strings (buttons, error messages, system UI) are currently available in en, nl, and de only. Custom locales will show these strings in English as a fallback.
