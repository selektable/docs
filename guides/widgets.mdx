# Widgets

A **widget** is the visualization experience embedded on your product pages. Each store can have multiple widgets with different configurations.

## Widget types

| Type | Best For | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Room Visualizer** | Furniture, decor, wall art, rugs, lighting | Renders products into a room photo |
| **Virtual Try-On** | Clothing, accessories, eyewear | Renders products onto a person photo |

## Creating a widget

1. Open your store in the Selektable dashboard
2. Click **Add Widget**
3. Choose a widget type and configure the options below
4. Copy the widget ID from the embed instructions

## Configuration options

### Appearance

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Accent Color** | Primary color for buttons and interactive elements | Inherited from store |
| **Accent Foreground Color** | Text color on accent-colored elements | Auto-detected |
| **Secondary Color** | Secondary UI color | System default |
| **Heading Font** | Font for headings (system, Google, or custom) | Inherited from parent page |
| **Body Font** | Font for body text | Inherited from parent page |

<Tip>
  The widget automatically detects fonts from your page. You only need to set fonts explicitly if you want the widget to use different fonts than your site.
</Tip>

### Generation

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Custom Style Guidance** | Additional instructions to fine-tune AI image generation (max 500 chars). See [Custom style guidance](#custom-style-guidance) below. | None |
| **Retention Hours** | How long generated images are stored (1-720 hours) | 24 |

### Features

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Multi-Product** | Allow 2-5 products per visualization | Disabled |
| **Show Products in Result** | Display product cards in the result view | Enabled |
| **Cart Integration** | Enable add-to-cart from the result view | Disabled |

### Integrations

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **WhatsApp** | Allow customers to share results via WhatsApp |

## Multi-Product mode

When enabled, customers can select multiple products to visualize together. This is useful for showing how items complement each other — for example, a sofa with a matching coffee table and rug.

Configure the maximum number of products (2-5) in the widget settings.

## Font detection

The embed script automatically detects your site's heading and body fonts by inspecting the computed styles of `<h1>` and `<body>` elements. These are sent to the widget iframe so the UI matches your site's typography.

To override this, set explicit fonts in the widget configuration.

## Custom style guidance

Custom style guidance lets you fine-tune how the AI generates visualizations for your widget. This is a free-text field (up to 500 characters) that gives the AI additional context about your products, brand aesthetic, or specific rendering instructions.

You can set this in the dashboard under your widget's **Generation** settings.

### When to use it

Style guidance is most useful when:

- Your products have a specific aesthetic that the AI should maintain (e.g., bridal, luxury, minimalist)
- You need the AI to handle product images in a particular way (e.g., keep the person in the photo, preserve specific lighting)
- Your product category benefits from extra context (e.g., "these are outdoor furniture items" or "these are children's clothing")

### Writing effective guidance

Be specific and descriptive. Tell the AI what to preserve, what style to aim for, and any constraints.

<Tip>
  Think of the guidance as a brief creative direction — you're telling the AI how you'd describe the ideal output to a designer.
</Tip>

**Example: bridal store (Virtual Try-On)**

```
The uploaded image contains a real person — always keep this person exactly
as they appear (face, body, pose, skin tone). Make them appear in a natural
position, arms down and elegant. Never replace them with a mannequin or model.

Show the bridal garment on this specific person. Maintain elegant, soft bridal
lighting with a clean, romantic aesthetic and use the location of the product
(input) image but replace the product model.
```

**Example: modern furniture store (Room Visualizer)**

```
Modern minimalist furniture store. Use clean, well-lit interiors with neutral
tones. Prefer Scandinavian-style room settings with natural light.
```

**Example: outdoor garden decor**

```
Outdoor garden and patio products. Place items in realistic outdoor settings
with natural lighting. Prefer lush green gardens or well-maintained patios.
```

**Example: children's room decor**

```
Bright, playful children's room settings. Use soft, warm lighting and
colorful but tasteful interiors. Keep the atmosphere fun and inviting.
```

### Tips for best results

- **Be specific about what to preserve** — especially for Virtual Try-On, tell the AI to keep the person's appearance exactly as-is
- **Describe the lighting and mood** — "soft bridal lighting" or "bright natural daylight" helps the AI match your brand
- **Mention what to avoid** — "never replace the person with a mannequin" prevents common issues
- **Keep it concise** — the field has a 500-character limit, so focus on the most impactful instructions
- **Test and iterate** — try different guidance text and compare the generation results to find what works best for your products

<Warning>
  Custom style guidance affects all generations for that widget. If you sell different product categories that need different guidance, consider creating separate widgets for each category.
</Warning>

## Preloading

For faster widget opening, you can preload the iframe before the user clicks:

```javascript
// Preload on page load (creates hidden iframe)
Selektable.preload('widget_abc123');

// Later, when user clicks, it opens instantly
Selektable.open('widget_abc123', { ... });
```

This is especially useful on product pages where you expect high engagement with the widget.
