# Widgets

A **widget** is the visualization experience embedded on your product pages. Each store can have multiple widgets with different configurations.

## Widget Types

| Type | Best For | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Room Visualizer** | Furniture, decor, wall art, rugs, lighting | Renders products into a room photo |
| **Virtual Try-On** | Clothing, accessories, eyewear | Renders products onto a person photo |

## Creating a Widget

1. Open your store in the Selektable dashboard
2. Click **Add Widget**
3. Choose a widget type and configure the options below
4. Copy the widget ID from the embed instructions

## Configuration Options

### Appearance

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Accent Color** | Primary color for buttons and interactive elements | Inherited from store |
| **Accent Foreground Color** | Text color on accent-colored elements | Auto-detected |
| **Secondary Color** | Secondary UI color | System default |
| **Heading Font** | Font for headings (system, Google, or custom) | Inherited from parent page |
| **Body Font** | Font for body text | Inherited from parent page |

<Tip>
  The widget automatically detects fonts from your page. You only need to set fonts explicitly if you want the widget to use different fonts than your site.

## Multi-Product Mode

When enabled, customers can select multiple products to visualize together. This is useful for showing how items complement each other — for example, a sofa with a matching coffee table and rug.

Configure the maximum number of products (2-5) in the widget settings.

## Font Detection

The embed script automatically detects your site's heading and body fonts by inspecting the computed styles of `<h1>` and `<body>` elements. These are sent to the widget iframe so the UI matches your site's typography.

To override this, set explicit fonts in the widget configuration.

## Preloading

For faster widget opening, you can preload the iframe before the user clicks:

```javascript
// Preload on page load (creates hidden iframe)
Selektable.preload('widget_abc123');

// Later, when user clicks, it opens instantly
Selektable.open('widget_abc123', { ... });
```

This is especially useful on product pages where you expect high engagement with the widget.
