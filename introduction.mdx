# Welcome to Selektable

Selektable lets your customers **visualize products before they buy**. Using AI-powered image generation, shoppers can see how furniture looks in their room or how clothing fits on them, directly from your product pages.

## What Selektable does

  <Card title="Room Visualizer" icon="couch">
    Customers upload a photo of their room and see your furniture or decor rendered realistically in their space.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Virtual Try-On" icon="shirt">
    Customers upload a photo of themselves and see how clothing items look on them.
  </Card>

## How it works

1. **You create a store** in the Selektable dashboard and configure a widget
2. **You embed the widget** on your product pages with a single script tag
3. **Customers click the button**, upload a photo, and see your product visualized in seconds
4. **Conversions are tracked** so you can measure the impact on sales

## Key features

- **Platform agnostic:** works with WooCommerce, Shopify, or any custom ecommerce platform
- **Simple embed:** one script tag and a button, no complex setup
- **Cart integration:** customers can add to cart directly from the visualization
- **Identity tracking:** associate visualizations with customers across sessions
- **Multi-language:** built-in support for English, Dutch, and German with custom locale overrides
- **Conversion attribution:** track which visualizations lead to purchases
