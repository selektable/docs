# Quickstart

This guide walks you through embedding a Selektable widget on your site.

## Prerequisites

- A Selektable account with an organization
- A store created in the dashboard
- A widget configured for your store (Room Visualizer or Virtual Try-On)

## Step 1: Get your widget ID

After creating a widget in the Selektable dashboard, you'll receive a **widget ID** (e.g., `widget_abc123`). Copy this. You'll need it for the embed code.

## Step 2: Add the embed script

Add the Selektable embed script before the closing `</body>` tag on your site:

```html
<script src="https://app.selektable.com/widgets/embed.js" async></script>
```

<Note>
  Replace `app.selektable.com` with your Selektable instance URL if you're self-hosting.
</Note>

## Step 3: Add a button

Add a button that opens the widget when clicked:

```html
<button onclick="Selektable.open('widget_abc123', {
  productId: 123,
  productTitle: 'Blue Sofa',
  productImage: 'https://example.com/product.jpg',
  productUrl: 'https://example.com/products/blue-sofa'
})">
  View in your room
</button>
```

## Step 4: Test it

Open your product page, click the button, and upload a photo. You should see your product visualized in the uploaded image.
