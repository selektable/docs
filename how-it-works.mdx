# How it works

Selektable uses AI image generation to create realistic product visualizations. Here's what happens under the hood when a customer uses the widget.

## The flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer opens the widget">
    The customer clicks the widget button on your product page. The Selektable embed script opens a full-screen modal with the widget UI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer uploads a photo">
    For **Room Visualizer**, they upload a photo of their room. For **Virtual Try-On**, they upload a photo of themselves.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI generates the visualization">
    Selektable sends the customer's photo and your product image to an AI model. The model renders the product realistically into the scene.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer sees the result">
    The generated image is displayed in the widget. The customer can download it, share it, or add the product to their cart.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

The system consists of three parts:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Web app where you manage stores, widgets, and view analytics |
| **Embed Script** | JavaScript SDK loaded on your product pages |
| **Widget iframe** | The visualization UI, rendered inside an iframe on your site |

The embed script handles communication between your page and the widget iframe using the `postMessage` API. This means the widget works on any domain without CORS issues.

## Widget types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Room Visualizer">
    Best for furniture, home decor, wall art, rugs, and lighting. The customer uploads a room photo and the AI places the product in the scene with realistic perspective and lighting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Virtual Try-On">
    Best for clothing, accessories, and eyewear. The customer uploads a photo of themselves and the AI renders the product on them.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Conversion tracking

Selektable tracks visualizations and correlates them with purchases:

1. Each customer gets a persistent **visitor ID** stored in the browser
2. When a customer generates a visualization, it's recorded with their visitor ID
3. When an order is placed, the webhook matches the order to any recent visualizations
4. The **attribution window** (default: 7 days) determines how far back to look

This gives you data on how many visualizations convert into actual purchases.
